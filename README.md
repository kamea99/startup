### Elevator Pitch

Does this sound like you? The new year begins and you brainstorm goals to become a better you, yet after only a few weeks you find that you've given up on most of them. What once was so important is nothing more than a disappointed hope and a deferment to "do it next year". [*name to come*] is an intuitive tracking app made to facilitate your goals and inspire real change. The controls are designed for ease of use, tracking is simplified, and vibrant colors promote daily usage, leading to personal improvement and excitement for growth. Enhance your well-being today, one habit at a time.
